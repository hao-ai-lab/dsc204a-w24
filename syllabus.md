The course is organized into four parts, covering the following topics.

1. **Foundations of Data Systems**: Data models, big data storage and retrieval, and how to encode information when you store data. 
2. **Scaling Distributed Systems**: Cluster, cloud, edge, network, replication, partition, consistency, ACID.
3. **Data Processing and Programming model**: Batch processing, stream processing, MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Ray.
4. **Machine Learning Systems**: GPUs, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Large language model training and serving systems.


A major component of this course is hands-on Python programming to implement data exploration, data preparation, distributed deep learning training, and model selection pipelines on large real-world data using popular libraries (Ray, PyTorch) and cloud resources (e.g., AWS/GCP).

## Logistics

**Lectures**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday 10:00 AM - 10:50 AM.

**Location**: [PCYNH 122](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3xRUTjk3cyVA7wAr6).

**Instructor**: [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/); Office: [HDSI 440](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XeWAcFsFk5bcs2ar5).

## Course Content and Format

- The class meets 3 times a week for 50-minute lectures in person.
    <!-- - All lectures will be automatically podcast here afterward. -->
    - Attending the lectures is not mandatory but highly encouraged.
    - There will be ready summary 
    - We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/ucsd/winter2024/dsc204a) for asynchronous discussions and questions.

- 3 Programming Assignments (PAs).
    - See the PAs page for the PA schedule and details.
    - There are no late days for the PAs. Plan your work accordingly.

- S

- Exams.
  - **There is NO midterm**. Cheers! 
  - There will be a final exam,
  - The final exam will be held as a Canvas Quiz only. The dates and logistics are listed below.
  - The exams will have primarily multiple choice questions (MCQ). Quantitative/longer problems wil exist but only the final answer may need to be selected. Some questions will have partial credits.
  - The guideline for time per question is a max of 1min per point. The points of each question will be calibrated accordingly.
  - If you miss an exam, you will get no credit for it, unless you notify the instructor in advance with a university approved reason and receive a makeup exam slot.
  - The midterm exam is closed books/notes/electronics/Web. You are allowed to keep with you two A4-sized sheets (four sides) with any content you want.
  - The final exam is open books/Web/etc. The only requirement is you should neither give nor receive help from anyone by any means.

- There will be 3 extra credit Peer Evaluation activities delivered via Canvas only. I will announce more details on these in due course.
- I will release ungraded exercises on the exercises page throughout the quarter. These questions will act as practice for the graded exams and surprise quizzes.
- The discussion slots will be used by the TAs to give talks about the PAs. I might also use them for review discussions before the two exams.

## Pre-requisites

DSC 202 (Data Mgt for Data Science); or substantial practical experience with scalable data systems and ML algorithms, subject to the consent of the instructor.

Proficiency in Python programming.


## Grading

**Components**: 
- Programming Assignments: 8% + 16% + 16%
- Final Exam: 40%
- Reading summary: NeruIPS format, once per week
- In-class Peer Instruction Activities: 20%
- 
- Extra Credit: 4% (likely)


**Cutoffs**: 
The grading scheme is a hybrid of absolute and relative grading. The absolute cutoffs are based on your absolute total score. The relative bins are based on your position in the total score distribution of the class. The better grade among the two (absolute-based and relative-based) will be your final grade.

**Example**: Suppose the total score is 82 and the percentile is 33. So, the relative grade is B-, while the absolute grade is B+. The final grade then is B+.

**Non-Letter Grade Options**: You have the option of taking this course for a non-letter grade. The policy for P in a P/F option is a letter grade of C- or better; for S in an S/U option is a letter grade of B- or better.


## Exam Dates

- Final Exam: TBD (in the week of March 16 - 23); time window: 3:00-7:00pm PT; time limit: 4 hours

## Classroom Rules
- <code>No late days</code> for submitting the PAs. No extensions on the final exam time window. Plan all your work well up front accordingly.
- Students are encouraged to ask questions and participate in discussions in class and on Ed. Please raise your hand before speaking and the instructor will call on you to speak.
- Please review UCSD's honor code and policies and procedures on [academic integrity](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/) here. If plagiarism is detected in your code, or if we detect collusion on the graded quizzes or exams, or if you are found to be using someone else's clickers, or if any other form of academic integrity violation is identified, you will get zero for that component of your score and get downgraded substantially. I will also notify the University authorities for appropriate disciplinary action to be taken, up to and including expulsion from the University.
- Please review UCSD's principles of community and our commitment to creating an inclusive learning environment on [this website](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).
- Harassment, discrimination, or intimidation of any form against any student will not be tolerated in class or on Piazza. Please review UCSD's policies on dealing with harassment and discrimination on [this website](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/).
